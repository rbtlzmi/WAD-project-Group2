## Healthcare System

## Introduction and Objectives
<text>  

## Features and Functionalities
A system's primary components are its features and functionalities. In our system,here are six features and functionalities for our system. 
The details are as follows:
<br>

**1. Registration of the clinic's staff** <br>
First and foremost, this system requires staff members like clinic assistants, nurses, or doctors to register. This is to ensure that all personnel information is preserved for clinic use only. Each clinic has multiple staff such as doctors, so each doctor must have its own information so that doctors can be assigned to their patients accordingly. Thus, registration for staff is necessary for personnel as a result in order to prevent informational confusion.<br>

**2.Log In for Staff** <br>
The staff log-in feature is crucial because it is one of the security features that ensures the staff using the system is legitimate and has been registered with the clinic. By doing this, data theft and other issues that can compromise patient and clinic security can be avoided. Due to this, the log-in feature is essential for ensuring the reliability and security of our system.<br>

**3.Registration for the clinic's patients**<br>
Every clinic needs a reliable registration system to prevent data from the same patient from being duplicated. When opposed to manual registration, the registration function's quality enables data to be kept accurately and without data loss. Patients' information can be carefully preserved so that it is accessible to them whenever they visit the clinic. This will cut down on time spent simultaneously searching and registering.Additionally, it assists in tracking blood type, medical history, and allergies to prevent errors when administering blood or drugs.<br>

**4.Booking patient's appointment through the staff**<br>
Making sure that patients or users can schedule doctor appointments through the staff is one of the characteristics and functionalities of this system. This will make the appointments schedule more structured and convenient to verify and access. It will also ensure that the same doctors are not given duplicate appointments, nor are the same patients given repeat appointments. This function also helps for patients not to come repeatedly to the clinic just to confirm and make their appointmens. Both the clinic's patients and employees will be satisfied aboutt this feature.<br>

**5.Prescription of the drugs given by doctors to patients**<br>
Every time we see the doctor, as is well known, doctors will assign us medication to prescribe. Sometimes, for each appointment, there are various types of drugs given by the doctors for the patients to consume in a specific of time. To ensure that the medication is administered correctly, it is crucial for the staff to maintain track of all prescription medications.As a result, by creating a special function for prescriptions, it enables the clinic to both track the medication's use and identify any issues or illnesses the patient may be experiencing.<br>

**6.Billing and Payment**<br>
Last but not least, after each appointment between patients and doctors, payment will be made after taking the medicine. each customer needs to pay a specific amount for the drugs and services given. Moreover, seniors citizen, insurance, and other discounts are available to patients Therefore, it is preferable to keep payment and invoicing information in case it becomes necessary at a later date.<br>
